I conduct workshops and events, giving people tools to connect with each other and with their personal life mission.

I have been running a men’s peer counseling group in Tokyo since 2015. I have been conducting workshops in both Tokyo and Kanagawa.

My experience in counseling and facilitation work includes:

* 4+ years leading a weekly peer counseling circles
