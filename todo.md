＜What is walking meditation?＞
Walking meditation is a simple way to improve awareness.

Connect with yourself. Connect with nature.

Anyone can do it. Let's enjoy walking slowly.

＜What to Expect＞
* We will find a nice place to relax and connect with nature.
* I will guide us in meditation, including walking meditation.
* Feel free to be barefoot; whatever makes you comfortable.
* We will go to a foot bath cafe after the park.
