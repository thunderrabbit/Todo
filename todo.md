The Shadow Work with Rob was surprisingly powerful for me. I was able to work on an incident buried deep in my past in living emotional colour and Rob's gentle guidance allowed it to percolate (big time).
Highly recommended.

＜What is walking meditation?＞
Walking meditation is a simple way to increase awareness.
Connect with yourself.  Connect with nature.
Anyone can do it, so let's enjoy walking.

＜What to Expect＞
* We will find a nice place to relax and connect with nature.
* I will guide us in meditation, including walking meditation.
* Feel free to be barefoot; whatever makes you comfortable.
* We will go to a foot bath cafe after the park. http://donyoku.dosl2018.net/237 (approx 1000 yen)
＜Shinjuku Gyoen＞
Covering 144 acres, Shinjuku Gyoen blends three distinct styles, Formal Garden, Landscape Garden, and Japanese Traditional Garden.
