Invite 5 men to Like new FB group
Write to men
I finally figured out how to phrase this.
I have hired a business development team and plan to start leading a new series of circles in Tokyo as part of The Bold Life Brotherhood.  Similar to my ShadowWork practice circles, I will be leading some practice circles for the Bold Life Brotherhood as well.  You men are invited to attend these practice circles at no charge (though I appreciate some support with room rental).  I have not yet set a date, but I have created a group on Facebook.  If you are interested in finding out more about these new circles, please visit the FB group.  I plan to continue doing MKP as well as Bold Life Brotherhood.

* Personal Mission Discovery
    Ever wondered why you are here on earth?  What is the point of all of this?
    Turns out you, yes you, are a unique manifestation of life in this moment.
    You are here to do *something*.  Would you like to know what it is?  Like
    most things in life, the answers are within.  Find the answer within an hour
    session during which you will remember what gift you have for the world.
* Goal Setting
    Knowing what you are here to do is a good start.
    Now let’s set some goals on how to bring that into practice.
    Goals can take many forms.  Are your current goals in line with what you truly want?
    Are you taking steps toward achieving those goals on a regular basis?
    Do the goals need to be broken down into more manageable bits?
    Are the steps well defined do you know if you are making progress?

Write email to Erik with list of sites I like and a couple I don't
HI Erik

Thank you for keeping on top of this.

Maybe my favorite of what I've found recently
https://www.bayemcneil.com/

I like the design and colors of these
http://futagogo.moe/
https://www.sunshine-massage-school.com/

I like this short page, but not the immediate popup
https://www.personalfinancecoaching.com/

I like the text and images on alternating sides here
https://www.theperformancecode.co/

I like the raw vulnerability in Michael's posts
https://michaeljiang.tumblr.com/

I like how the menu stays visible as we scroll
http://catallen.yoga/

I like the huge picture layout of Maha's https://treeful.net/ and Michael's http://www.michaelsloyer.com/ but not sure what my analogous version would be

As I mentioned before, I like Dean's site because it is low key.  It was hard for me to find a call to action or know how to navigate, but I still like it.
http://deanramsden.com/    I do not think I have enough content yet to even attempt that site, but it's something to strive toward over time as I develop my offerings.

There seems to be a trend of long scrolling top pages.  I don't honestly want that type, but it seems most of my friends' sites are like that
https://www.helmwood.com/
https://www.menyahinga.com/
https://mauisbestmassage.com/
https://www.piers-cross.com/
https://thewealthsource.com/
http://amandarobins.com/
https://www.bridgingspaces.nl/en/
http://www.truensight.com/
http://www.michaeljohngrist.com/
http://greenagel.com/


Here is an example of what I do *not* want the page to be like, because I think it is annoying and boasting.  There certainly may be some 3rd round work for me to do on why I do not like this   https://www.theboldlifebrotherhood.com/blb2020home33950414

I will look at writing some descriptions of the services.

Receive testimonial from Mohamed
    i consider rob as my brother. It took me sometime to fully trust him
    not gonna lie. the camping trip was when i realized that i could trust
    this man with my life. Talking to him about issues is difficult in a
    sense that it makes me see parts in myself that i dont necessarily
    want to see. I like that I can talk to him about everything. He doesnt
    seem judgemental at all and when he's judging, he expresses it which i
    like. I feel he is really transparent and is "out there". like hey
