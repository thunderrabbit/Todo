Invite 5 men to Like new FB group
Write to men
I finally figured out how to phrase this.
I have hired a business development team and plan to start leading a new series of circles in Tokyo as part of The Bold Life Brotherhood.  Similar to my ShadowWork practice circles, I will be leading some practice circles for the Bold Life Brotherhood as well.  You men are invited to attend these practice circles at no charge (though I appreciate some support with room rental).  I have not yet set a date, but I have created a group on Facebook.  If you are interested in finding out more about these new circles, please visit the FB group.  I plan to continue doing MKP as well as Bold Life Brotherhood.

HI Erik

Thank you for keeping on top of this.

Maybe my favorite of what I've found recently
https://www.bayemcneil.com/

I like the design and colors of these
http://futagogo.moe/
https://www.sunshine-massage-school.com/

I like this short page, but not the immediate popup
https://www.personalfinancecoaching.com/

I like the text and images on alternating sides here
https://www.theperformancecode.co/

I like the raw vulnerability in Michael's posts
https://michaeljiang.tumblr.com/

I like how the menu stays visible as we scroll
http://catallen.yoga/

I like the huge picture layout of Maha's https://treeful.net/ and Michael's http://www.michaelsloyer.com/ but not sure what my analogous version would be

As I mentioned before, I like Dean's site because it is low key.  It was hard for me to find a call to action or know how to navigate, but I still like it.
http://deanramsden.com/    I do not think I have enough content yet to even attempt that site, but it's something to strive toward over time as I develop my offerings.

There seems to be a trend of long scrolling top pages.  I don't honestly want that type, but it seems most of my friends' sites are like that
https://www.helmwood.com/
https://www.menyahinga.com/
https://mauisbestmassage.com/
https://www.piers-cross.com/
https://thewealthsource.com/
http://amandarobins.com/
https://www.bridgingspaces.nl/en/
http://www.truensight.com/
http://www.michaeljohngrist.com/
http://greenagel.com/


Here is an example of what I do *not* want the page to be like, because I think it is annoying and boasting.  There certainly may be some 3rd round work for me to do on why I do not like this   https://www.theboldlifebrotherhood.com/blb2020home33950414

I will look at writing some descriptions of the services.

Receive testimonial from Mohamed
    i consider rob as my brother. It took me sometime to fully trust him
    not gonna lie. the camping trip was when i realized that i could trust
    this man with my life. Talking to him about issues is difficult in a
    sense that it makes me see parts in myself that i dont necessarily
    want to see. I like that I can talk to him about everything. He doesnt
    seem judgemental at all and when he's judging, he expresses it which i
    like. I feel he is really transparent and is "out there". like hey
