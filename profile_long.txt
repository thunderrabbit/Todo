I conduct workshops and events, giving people tools to connect with each other and with their personal life mission.

I have been running a men’s peer counseling group in Tokyo since 2015. I have been conducting spiritual workshops in both Tokyo and Kanagawa. I am currently training towards certification in shadow work. This process aims to put people more in touch with the hidden aspects of themselves also known as their shadow.

As a 17-year resident in Kanagawa, I am fully aware of both the joys and pitfalls of life in Japan. In the middle of work, relationships, and other commitments, it is easy to feel cut off, isolated, and eager to find something more meaningful.

My experience in counseling and facilitation work includes:

* 10+ years attending and 4+ years leading a weekly peer counseling circle for men
* 1+ year’s experience suicide hotline volunteer
* 17+ years barefoot walking in Houston Texas and Tokyo Japan
* Shamanic healing training
* ShadowWork basic training
